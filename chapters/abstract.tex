In modern profesional music studios, the computer has become responsible for tasks that were previously performed by dedicated equipement. Mixing boards, effect processors, dynamic compressors and equalizers, even the instruments themselves, are all available as software. To elivate the processing load on the CPU there is a growing market for specialized DSP coprocessors which can process mutliple channels of digital audio in realtime. These coprocessors are typically connected via Firewire or PCIe and use multiple DSP chips for the processing. This project will examine an inexpensive alternative based on standard Gigabit Ethernet and higher end Raspberry Pi clones.
