\section{Virtual Analog Synthesis}

Virtual analog synthesis is the term used to describe the emulation of analog synthsizers of the 60s and 70s digitally in real time. The complexity and goals of an emulation can vary. Some emulations go so far as to simulate the actual electronic components of vintage synthesis circuits, others just model ths signal flow loosly.

Regardless of the type of emulation, virtual analog systhesis has two primary concerns, latency and aliasing. The problem of latency has already been described above. Any processing will introduce a delay in the signal, the complexity of the processing can increase the delay, or use more CPU cycles. Aliasing is audible distortion introduced by signals that have a higher frequency content than the sampling rate of the system allows for.

Analog synthsizers usually employ subtractive synthsis. One or more sound generators or oscillators would create signals with particular harmonic qualities. These signals are passed through filters that "subtract" frequencies from the signal. The oscillators, filters, and amplitude can be modulated. Figure~\ref{fig:synth_voice_block} is a simple block diagram of a typical subtractive synth voice.

The voltage controlled oscillators generate simple waveforms at the pitch coresponding to the note played on the keyboard. The user can typically choose between some combination of sawtooth, squareware, or triangle waveforms. The frequencies or timbre of the waveforms can then be modulated by the following filter and amplitude blocks.

One's first impression might be that modeling the oscillator would be simple. A digitally generated squarewave or sawtooth waveform should be trivial to implement. The 5kHz sawtooth waveform for example, would have a period of 8.82 samples when generated in a 44.1kHz audio environment. So the waveform would increase linearly from -1.0 to 1.0 over a length of 8.82 samples, then jump back to -1.0 and cycle through again. What does 0.82 sample mean in a discreet digital system? Figure~\ref{fig:aliasing_sawtooth} illustrates the problem with a trivial implementation. The left column shows a portion of an idealized 5kHz sawtooth waveform and the corresponding frequency content. Above the 5kHz fundamental frequency are harmonics that will be audible well beyond 100kHz. The right column shows the same portion of a 5khz sawtooth waveform in a 44.1kHz discrete environment. The waveform itself is distorted and the higher harmonics are visible reflected back from the 22.05kHz nyquist limit.

There are various methods to eliminate or reduce aliasing. The most effective is to generate the harmonics using a series of sin waves up to the nyquist limit or half of the system's sampling rate, but this also very processing intensive. Less CPU intensive strategies involve using oversampling, bandlimiting, or other alias-supressing methods\cite{virtual_analog_synthesis}.
