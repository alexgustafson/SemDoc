\subsection{Socket Monitor}

The socket monitor class uses a posix select() function to montitor the status of a collection of socket file descriptors. When a file descriptor is ready to read from or write to the socket monitor can notify a registered delegate class via a specified callback.

\begin{itemize}

\item runs as a thread, blocks on select() until one of the managed filedescriptors becomes ready to read then notifies corresponding listener

\item define abstract listener class: FileDescriptorListener
\item select can be configured with a timeout, unblocking the call, inorder to check status of application ( everything ok? should i shut down? should i update? etc..Â ) but it is more effiecient to use a control socket that can be trigged by the app to unblock the select call when needed.
