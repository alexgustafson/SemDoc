These are general C++ components that are used in both the audio plugin and the processing nodes. They encapsulate the network communicatation handling.

\subsection{Socket Monitor}

The socket monitor class uses a posix select() function to montitor the status of a collection of socket file descriptors. When a file descriptor becomes ready to read from or write to the socket monitor can notify a registered delegate class via a specified callback.

\begin{itemize}

\item runs as a thread, blocks on select() until one of the managed filedescriptors becomes ready to read then notifies corresponding listener

\item define abstract listener class: FileDescriptorListener
\item select can be configured with a timeout, unblocking the call, inorder to check status of application (everything ok? should i shut down? should i update? etc..) but it is more effiecient to use a control socket that can be trigged by the app to unblock the select call when needed.

\subsection{ZeroConf Manager}

The ZeroConf Manager class encapsulates calls to the system's bonjour/zeroconf deamon.

\subsection{AudioStream Manager}

This class is responsible for streaming audio data to or from a specified udp port. It implements
