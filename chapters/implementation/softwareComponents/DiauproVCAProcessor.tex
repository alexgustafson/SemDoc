\subsection{DiauproVCAProcessor}

The DiauproVCAProcessor modulates the amplitude of a signal over time. VCA is short for Voltage Controlled Amplifier, this referes to the processing block in a virtual synthsizer that is responsible for the "shape" of a sound. A bell sound, for instance, will have a fast and loud initial tone that gradually decays to silence over a long period of time. In contrast, a bowed string sound, like a violin, might have a slow rising initial tone that suddenly ends. The VCA is responsible for the shaping of the amplitude of a sound.
